I'm making you a mixtape.

## What?

I'm interested in how music finds listeners. Having witnessed the evolution of this process, I've seen it transform in so many crazy ways. Today, we're at some kind of peak: musicians have unprecedented tools to connect directly with their audience. From bedroom studios to your space, artists can now create and share their work more intimately than ever before.

But before this gap between musician and listener started to close, there was a middleman called the mixtape maker. Those people who took the music and manually delivered it to the people they wanted to share it with. At the time, this idea of home taping was said to be "killing music".

We made mixtapes to share what we loved. We made mixtapes with secret coded messages we hoped our crush would pick up on. We made mixtapes to show off our knowledge and taste. We made mixtapes to express how we felt. Each mixtape is a monument to a moment in time. A message from a human, encoded in music, that represents their unique expression.

So... I'm making you a mixtape.

## How?

Can you feel it? The pull of the algorithm? It's just so much easier to let the algo decide what to listen to. And why would I bother sharing music? I assume the algo's taking care of them as well, right? We take our hands off the wheel, lean back, close our eyes and go wherever the flow of statistical modelling takes us.

This is my attempt to swim against that tide, just a tiny bit.
